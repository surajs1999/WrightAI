# WrightAI — AI Code Documentation for VS Code

WrightAI brings AI-powered documentation directly into your editor. Generate docstrings, track coverage, detect drift, and chat with your codebase — all without leaving VS Code.

Powered by Claude (Anthropic). No local server or Python installation required — the backend is fully hosted.

## Getting Started

1. Install this extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Sign in at **[www.wrightai.live](https://www.wrightai.live)** with GitHub or Google
3. Copy your personal API key (starts with `wai_`)
4. Open VS Code Settings (`Cmd+,` / `Ctrl+,`), search for `WrightAI`, and paste the key into **Wright: Api Key**
5. Open any supported file — a **Generate Docs** button will appear above each function

## Features

### Generate Docstrings
Click the **Generate Docs** CodeLens button above any function, or press `Cmd+Shift+D` / `Ctrl+Shift+D` with your cursor inside a function.

A **side-by-side diff preview** shows the generated docstring before anything is written — accept or discard with one click. Accepting applies the change directly to your file and auto-refreshes the coverage panel.

You can also right-click and choose **Wright: Generate docs for this function** from the context menu, or hover over any function name to see a **Regenerate** link inline.

### Generate Docs for Entire File
Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run:
```
Wright: Generate docs for entire file
```
WrightAI documents every undocumented function in the file with a live progress bar.

### Gutter Icons
Every function line shows a status icon in the editor gutter:
- **✓** (green) — documented and up to date
- **○** (grey) — no documentation yet
- **⚠** (amber) — documentation has drifted (signature changed since docs were written)

### Coverage Panel
The **Wright Coverage** panel in the Explorer sidebar shows live documentation metrics — coverage %, documented count, undocumented count, and drifted count. Refreshes automatically on every file save or docstring injection.

### Drift Detection
Wright flags drift when parameter names change or return type changes between concrete types (e.g. `str → dict`). Stale functions are highlighted with an **⚠ Docs outdated** CodeLens. Drift is also checked automatically on every save.

### Chat with Your Codebase
Run **Wright: Chat with codebase** from the Command Palette to open an interactive chat panel. Answers stream in real time with clickable file:line citations.
